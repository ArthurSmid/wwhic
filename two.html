    <h1>A story is between reality and what you believe.</h1>
    <p>
      Reality is reduced to a story so it can be understood, even if only primitively. There are limits to stories: the perspective of the narrator, the method of delivery, what can be understood by the listener. We have only a story. But the story is importantâ€”it informs our behavior.

    <h1>Beliefs inform our behavior.</h1>
    <p>
      At all times, everywhere I go, a story about life informs my decisions. Ultimately, our stories are about relationships, the rules and expectations of a social being. Your idea of your relationship to the world determines how you act within it.
