    <h1>Values are conscious and unconscious beliefs about life.</h1>
    <p>
      Your job, your community, your nation: all inform your values. It’s not easy to find a value that everyone shares. People have different values depending on how they source their power.
    </p>
    <h1>Where do you get your power?</h1>
    <p>
      To ensure survival, people adapt to their surroundings. How one chooses to survive in society is an expression of their values. Conditions that empower an individual will influence their values—it could happen within their community, school, profession, or even a relationship.
    </p>
    <h1>What do you believe in when you believe in yourself?</h1>
    <p>
      The family, the tribe, the community have all contributed to your beliefs. What is the source of confidence? What is the nature of insecurity? When you face the end of yourself, you can find answers to your questions. It can be an elaborate story, even science needs a story to be understood.
