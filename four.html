    <h1>We recognize our connection to a meaningful existence through storytelling.</h1>
    <p>
      For history to have definition beyond an outline, we have to process information over many years. How do we interpret the past? Is history an agreement? Is history an argument? What is the victor’s history?
    </p>
    <h1>For every possible belief there is someone to believe it.</h1>
    <p>
      People can believe anything and believe it is true. Belief can be willed. You can believe something to be true because you want it to be true, or because someone told you it was true. If people can believe anything they want and believe they are right, how can you tell when you’re deceiving yourself or when your perception of reality is being manipulated by others?
    </p>
    <h1>We ask questions to learn the truth.</h1>
    <p>
      There is a difference between the desire to learn and the desire to be right. Convincing arguments and presentations of select pieces of information can create a desired perception of reality. Actively questioning your beliefs leads to greater awareness.
    </p>
    <h1>To arrive at a shared understanding, look at the problem together.</h1>
    <p>
      No one has perfect information. Simply ask questions about what can be perceived by everyone without needing people to acknowledge your beliefs. Rather than stating your beliefs, restate the problem.
